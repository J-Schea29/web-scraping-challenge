# web-scraping-challenge

# Part 1
For this project, I had to scrape data from the websites [I'm an inline-style link](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/), [I'm an inline-style link](https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html), [I'm an inline-style link](https://space-facts.com/mars/), and [I'm an inline-style link](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars). I did this using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.
