# web-scraping-challenge

# Part 1
For this project, I had to scrape data from the websites <https://mars.nasa.gov/news/>, <https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html>, <https://space-facts.com/mars/>, and <https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars>. I did this using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.
