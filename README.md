# web-scraping-challenge

# Part 1
For this project, I had to scrape data from [NASA Mars News site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/), [JPL Featured Space Image](https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html), [Space-Facts site](https://space-facts.com/mars/), and [USGS Astrogeology site](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars). I did this using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.
