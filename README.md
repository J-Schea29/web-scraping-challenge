# web-scraping-challenge

# Part 1
For this project, I had to scrape data from several on Mars from several websites and present it on a webpage using flask (with a button to scrape most recent data). I did this using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. 

[NASA Mars News website](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/), <https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html>, [Space-Facts website](https://space-facts.com/mars/), and [USGS Astrogeology website](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars).
